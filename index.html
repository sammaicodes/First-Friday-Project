    <h3>About me:</h3>
    <p>A bit about my background... where to start...for me writing is just as tough as learning how to code. I grew up in <span class="mayan">Cancun, Mexico </span> and moved to <strong>PDX</strong> in 2011 to finish my last year of high school. Since then I have learned alot lots of things including; English, snowboarding, kyteboarding, hunting, and <em>programming</em>. I have worked in so many different places such as delivering mushrooms for a organic CSA, teaching snowboarding at Mt Hood Meadows, retail, and currently working in the unmanned military aircraft business in the Columbia River George area. As far as education, I am a standing junior at PSU majoring in Mechanical Engineering, I had to pause PSU due to online making the curve test so high due to people cheating and labs being online seemed like a waste of money. I had some classes at PSU on control systems and automation using MATLAB and c/c++. I really like the power of programing and I like the idea of being in an industry where I can constantly learn and create.
